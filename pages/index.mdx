# Hi Everyone ðŸ‘‹

I'm a software engineer, problem-solver, and mentor who's passionate about coding specialized in Back-end. I believe anyone want a secure system and very performant apps to enjoy the online journey, and that is why I care about building very usefull apps and system which provide the best preformance and security.

I started using the computer since I was 6 I played with the hardware parts everytime I miss up and broke something, I found that I want to make apps that make my live easier while I enjoy my time, so I went with Visual Basic and I faild, now I'm starting new journey with JavaScript and Rust.
